tidal_stripping.orig.cc  The first one I got to work,
    but this may be do to numerics.  Decreasing the
    timestep makes the stars stay together.

tidal_stripping.orbit_separating_example.cc I don't think
    either of these stars get bound to the blackhole but
    they certainly seem to unbound from each other.

tidal_stripping.works_in_a_weird_way.cc
    Yeah, something weird happens here.  I think it's because
    we don't have adaptive timestepping so the orbit close in
    to the blackhole isn't represented accurately.
