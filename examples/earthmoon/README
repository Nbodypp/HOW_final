This is an example of defining an external potential and including it in the code.

Instead of including the Sun explicitly as a particle in the 'input.ini' file, only the Earth 
and Moon are included as particles; the Sun is swapped for an external potential defined in 
'external_central_potential.cc'.

'plot.py' will take the output from 'earthmoon' and plot the orbits of the Earth and Moon

This example here is only a basic example of what can be a very powerful tool
in the code: gravity does not need to be explicitly included by including particles with 
certain masses; gravitational fields of all kinds can be written up separately and
included in the code.
